Sometimes I code things. But you already suspect this. However you might not know that: I do this, mainly, because I find it immensely interesting to explore and participate in humanity's buildup to higher and higher levels of cognitive achievements. At the same time, this abstract knowledge can freak me out and make me disappear into a deep valley off the grid. In this valley I would like to imagine the followings:
- a campfire is burning near a stream of fresh spring water 🔥
- tea is prepared to be enjoyed by the most diverse people around the fire 🍵
- life is abundant all around 🌳
- the cosmos is happily embracing itself through each of us 🫂

If I can help you with this, reach out. If you can help me with this, reach out. 👋
